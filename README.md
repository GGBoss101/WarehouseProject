# My Personal Project

## A warehouse inventory management system

- The application is going to be a warehouse management system which will allow the user to store items in a warehouse
and keep track of them.
- The appropriate users will likely be employees of a warehouse business.
- This project will allow me to better understand how to create a system that can actually carry out tasks in a
professional setting, which is why I chose this idea.
## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to collect and add items to the warehouse inventory.
- As a user, I want to be able to display the items currently in the warehouse inventory.
- As a user, I want to be able to ship out the items from the warehouse inventory.
- As a user, I want to be able to get the descriptions of specific items from the inventory.
- As a user, I want to be able to save my current inventory.
- As a user, I want to be able to load a pre-existing inventory into the program from a file.
